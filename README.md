# About
#### Time Slot Booker is an application made for the practical test assigned to me by "Digital-Trons" as part of their Interview Process.It has time slots which as user can book by entering it details and a user-friendly UI. I've also included a feature to switch between Online and Offline mode. More regarding this is explained in Screenshots section. It also makes use of Dart's newest feature, "Null-Safety."
